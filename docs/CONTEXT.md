  *I know what works but struggle with daily habits*

#### Explanation Text
> "This reveals everything about your vocabulary acquisition. Looking things up without a system is like filling a bucket with holes. Having Anki but not using it daily is like owning a Ferrari and walking to work."

---

### Question 9: Grammar Study Approach

**Type:** Multiple Choice (Single Select)  
**Purpose:** Assess grammar relationship and usage patterns

---

### Question 12: Speaking Priority & Context

**Type:** Multiple Choice (Single Select)  
**Purpose:** Input-first vs. balanced vs. urgent output needs

#### Question Text
> "How important is speaking *right now* for your situation?"

  *I understand a lot but freeze when I try to talk*

- **"I'm already speaking but want improvement"**  
  *I can have conversations but want to sound more natural*

#### Explanation Text
> "This isn't about whether speaking is 'important' - of course it is. This is about whether you need speaking skills immediately or if you can build a massive comprehension foundation first."

---

### Question 13: Learning Obstacles

**Type:** Multiple Choice (Single Select)  
**Purpose:** Specific problem identification for targeted solutions

#### Question Text
> "What's your biggest obstacle to consistent daily immersion right now?"

- **"I'm already doing pretty well"**  
  *I have most things figured out, just want to optimize*

#### Explanation Text
> "Be brutally honest here. I've been exactly where you are, and I know the real obstacles aren't what we think they are. Your biggest barrier isn't lack of time or talent - it's usually something much more specific and solvable."

---

### Question 14: Communication Preference

**Type:** Multiple Choice (Single Select)  
**Purpose:** Customize tone of reality check email

#### Question Text
> "How do you prefer to receive honest feedback about your language learning approach?"

#### Options
- **"Give it to me straight"**  
  *I want the honest truth, even if it's uncomfortable to hear*

- **"Be encouraging but realistic"**

  *I need someone to push me outside my comfort zone*

- **"Just give me the plan"**  
  *Skip the psychology, I just want to know what to do next*

#### Explanation Text
> "This determines how I'll deliver your results. Some people need tough love to break through denial. Others need encouragement to overcome perfectionist paralysis. I want to give you exactly the kind of guidance that will actually help you take action."

        study: 0.2,
        output: 0.1
    };
    
    // Adjust based on speaking priority
    if (speaking === 'input_king') {

    }
    
    // Adjust for beginner level
    if (level === 'beginner') {
        ratios.study += 0.1;
        ratios.immersion -= 0.1;
    }
    
    // Calculate actual minutes
    const immersionTime = Math.round((time * ratios.immersion) / 5) * 5;
    const studyTime = Math.round((time * ratios.study) / 5) * 5;
    const outputTime = Math.max(0, time - immersionTime - studyTime);
    
    return { 
        immersionTime, 
        studyTime, 
        outputTime,

## User Interface Requirements

### Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Progressive Disclosure** | One question per screen to maintain focus and reduce cognitive load |
| **Clear Explanations** | Every option includes descriptive text to eliminate confusion |
| **Visual Feedback** | Progress bar, hover states, smooth transitions for engagement |
| **Mobile Responsive** | Touch-friendly interface optimized for mobile users |
| **Accessible** | Screen reader compatible, keyboard navigation, proper ARIA labels |
| **Performance** | Fast loading, smooth animations, optimized images |

### Visual Components

#### Progress Indicator
```css
.progress-bar {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 4px;
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #4F46E5, #7C3AED);
    transform: scaleX(var(--progress));
    transform-origin: left;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
```

#### Question Layout
- **Container**: Centered content, max-width 800px
- **Typography**: Large, readable fonts (18px+ body, 24px+ headings)
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace between options (16px minimum)
- **Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between question, options, and explanations

#### Option Cards
```css
.option-card {
    padding: 20px;
    border: 2px solid #E5E7EB;
    border-radius: 12px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
    min-height: 44px; /* Touch target minimum */
}

.option-card:hover {
    border-color: #4F46E5;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(79, 70, 229, 0.15);
    transform: translateY(-2px);
}

.option-card.selected {
    border-color: #4F46E5;
    background-color: #EEF2FF;
}
```

#### Navigation Controls
- **Position**: Bottom right, consistent across all questions
- **Keyboard Support**: Arrow keys for navigation, Enter to proceed
- **States**: Disabled when no selection, loading state for processing

### Responsive Breakpoints

| Device | Breakpoint | Layout Adjustments |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Mobile | < 768px | Single column, larger touch targets, simplified navigation |
| Tablet | 768px - 1024px | Optimized spacing, touch-friendly interactions |
| Desktop | > 1024px | Full layout, hover effects, keyboard shortcuts |

## Email Capture & Follow-up System

### Email Capture Flow

#### Results Page Integration
1. **Immediate Value**: Display results immediately (no email gate)
2. **Strategic Placement**: Email capture positioned below results
3. **Value Proposition**: "Get your personalized 6-month reality check"
4. **Compelling Copy**: "Where will you be in 6 months if you continue like this? I'll send you a personalized assessment of your trajectory."

#### Email Form Design
```html
<form class="email-capture-form">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="email">Email Address</label>
        <input 
            type="email" 
            id="email" 
            placeholder="your.email@example.com"
            required
        />
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="cta-button">
        Send My Reality Check
    </button>
    <p class="privacy-note">
        No spam. Unsubscribe anytime. Privacy policy.
    </p>
</form>
```

### Personalized Email Content Structure

#### Email Template Framework
```markdown
Subject: [PERSONALIZED] Your [PROFILE_TYPE] reality check is here

#### Tone Customization Matrix

| Communication Preference | Email Tone | Example Opening |
|-------------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Give it to me straight** | Direct, no-nonsense | "Let's cut through the BS about your Korean learning..." |
| **Encouraging but realistic** | Supportive but honest | "You're making progress, but here's what's really holding you back..." |
| **Focus on what I'm doing right** | Positive reinforcement | "You're already doing 3 things right that most learners miss..." |
| **Challenge me** | Competitive, motivational | "Think you're serious about Korean? Prove it with these challenges..." |
| **Just give me the plan** | Action-focused, minimal psychology | "Your personalized action plan (skip the theory):" |
